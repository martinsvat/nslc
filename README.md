# Neural-Symbolic Learning Cycle
Neural-Symbolic Learning Cycle framework

This repository is under construction and will contain, in a near future, codes for Revisiting Neural-Symbolic Learning Cycle (NESY'19 workshop) by Martin Svatoš, Gustav Šourek and Filip Železný. 

In need of the code, please let me known by sending an e-mail to svatoma1@fel.cvut.cz.
